I’m thrilled to share that we won <strong>2nd place</strong> in the competition!</p> <h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2> <p>The hackathon focused on leveraging Generative AI to solve real-world problems in the aviation industry. Our team tackled the challenge of streamlining airline fault reporting—a critical process that can significantly impact operational efficiency and passenger experience.</p> <h2 id="our-solution-multi-agent-genai-system">Our Solution: Multi-Agent GenAI System</h2> <p>We architected a modular multi-agent system using <strong>LangChain</strong> and <strong>Google’s Gemini</strong> to handle multimodal inputs and automate issue triage. The system seamlessly operates across iOS, Android, and web applications, making it accessible to maintenance crews regardless of their device preference.</p> <h3 id="key-features">Key Features</h3> <p><strong>1. Specialized AI Agents</strong> Our system integrated four specialized agents, each with a distinct role:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Image Agent</strong>: Classifies and analyzes fault images uploaded by maintenance crews</li> <li><strong>Form Agent</strong>: Auto-fills structured forms based on extracted information</li> <li><strong>Submission Agent</strong>: Handles the submission workflow and data validation</li> <li><strong>Supervisor Agent</strong>: Orchestrates the entire process and ensures quality control</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> We implemented RAG-driven fault resolution pipelines that query knowledge bases to provide accurate, context-aware solutions. This approach significantly improved response time and accuracy compared to traditional manual processes.</p> <p><strong>3. Multimodal Input Handling</strong> The system can process various input types:</p> <ul> <li>Images of faulty equipment</li> <li>Text descriptions</li> <li>Structured form data</li> <li>Voice recordings (via transcription)</li> </ul> <swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true"> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/united_hackathon/IMG_9495.JPG" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/united_hackathon/IMG_9495.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/united_hackathon/9EEA0E05-0901-45B3-9E70-9AB9F8E6B1ED.JPG" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/united_hackathon/9EEA0E05-0901-45B3-9E70-9AB9F8E6B1ED.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/united_hackathon/Screenshot%202025-06-29%20at%206.24.15%20PM-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/united_hackathon/Screenshot%202025-06-29%20at%206.24.15%20PM-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/united_hackathon/Screenshot%202025-06-29%20at%206.24.15%20PM-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/united_hackathon/Screenshot%202025-06-29%20at%206.24.15%20PM.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> </swiper-container> <h2 id="demo-video">Demo Video</h2> <p>Here’s a screen recording demonstrating our multi-agent system in action:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/Screen%20Recording%202025-06-23%20at%208.36.07%20AM.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" controls=""/> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Demo of the United Phoenix multi-agent GenAI system for airline fault reporting </div> <h2 id="technical-architecture">Technical Architecture</h2> <p>The system was built with scalability and reliability in mind:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Backend</strong>: Python with LangChain for agent orchestration</li> <li><strong>LLM</strong>: Google Gemini 2.5 for natural language understanding and generation</li> <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: Cross-platform mobile app (React Native with Expo Go) and web interface</li> <li><strong>Integration</strong>: RESTful APIs connecting all components</li> </ul> <h2 id="key-learnings">Key Learnings</h2> <p>This hackathon was an incredible learning experience that reinforced several important lessons:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Multi-Agent Systems</strong>: Breaking down complex problems into specialized agents makes systems more maintainable and effective</li> <li><strong>RAG for Domain Knowledge</strong>: Retrieval-augmented generation is crucial when dealing with domain-specific information that needs to be accurate and up-to-date</li> <li><strong>Multimodal AI</strong>: The future of AI applications lies in seamlessly handling different input types</li> <li><strong>Rapid Prototyping</strong>: The hackathon format pushed us to build a working solution quickly while maintaining code quality</li> </ol> <h2 id="impact">Impact</h2> <p>Our solution demonstrated significant potential for improving airline operations:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Faster Response Times</strong>: Automated triage reduces time from fault detection to resolution</li> <li><strong>Improved Accuracy</strong>: AI-powered classification reduces human error</li> <li><strong>Better Resource Allocation</strong>: Intelligent routing ensures issues reach the right teams quickly</li> <li><strong>Enhanced Documentation</strong>: Automated form filling ensures consistent, complete records</li> </ul> <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2> <p>Winning 2nd place at this hackathon was incredibly rewarding, but the real value came from the experience of working with cutting-edge GenAI technologies and solving a real-world problem.
