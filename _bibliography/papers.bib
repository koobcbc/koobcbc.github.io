  abstract={Metal artifacts in computed tomography (CT) can severely degrade image quality and compromise dose calculation accuracy in radiation oncology. This study presents a quantitative comparison of four commercial metal artifact reduction (MAR) algorithms—SEMAR (Canon), Smart-MAR (GE), O-MAR (Philips), and iMAR (Siemens)—using a standardized phantom-based evaluation. A custom resin phantom containing interchangeable inserts (solid water, aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel) was scanned on each system, and proprietary MAR algorithms were applied. Quantitative analysis included (1) circular profile assessment of mean CT number (CTN) deviations, (2) geometric accuracy evaluation of metallic inserts, and (3) volumetric artifact quantification via a composite M Error Index integrating artifact extent and intensity. All MAR methods showed reduced |ΔCTN| at mid-to-far distances from metal interfaces, but notable residual deviations near metal boundaries. SEMAR and iMAR demonstrated the most consistent geometric accuracy (<5%) and lowest M Error values (0.00–0.83), while O-MAR exhibited higher deviations (1.15–2.46). Smart-MAR showed the largest CTN errors for aluminum and stainless steel. Overall, this study establishes a quantitative benchmarking framework for cross-vendor MAR performance, offering objective metrics to inform system selection and improve confidence in CT-based treatment planning for patients with metal implants.},

  abstract={Proper defense against microbial infection depends on the controlled activation of the immune system. This is particularly important for the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which recognize viral dsRNA and initiate antiviral innate immune responses with the potential of triggering systemic inflammation and immunopathology. Here, we show that stress granules (SGs), molecular condensates that form in response to various stresses including viral dsRNA, play key roles in the controlled activation of RLR signaling. Without the SG nucleators G3BP1/2 and UBAP2L, dsRNA triggers excessive inflammation and immune-mediated apoptosis. In addition to exogenous dsRNA, host-derived dsRNA generated in response to ADAR1 deficiency is also controlled by SG biology. Intriguingly, SGs can function beyond immune control by suppressing viral replication independently of the RLR pathway. These observations thus highlight the multi-functional nature of SGs as cellular ``shock absorbers'' that converge on protecting cell homeostasis by dampening both toxic immune response and viral replication.},

  abstract={Conventional radiotherapy vault shielding standards, based on NCRP guidelines from the 1970s, mandate 2–3 m of concrete, consuming valuable clinical space and limiting treatment capacity. Modern linear accelerators (LINACs), such as the Varian Ethos, employ self-shielding designs and 6 MV flattening-filter-free (FFF) beams that eliminate neutron production, suggesting that current standards may be overly conservative. This study evaluated advanced nanostructured shielding materials—high-density polymer composites and metal oxide–infused concretes—as alternatives to conventional barriers using TOPAS Monte Carlo simulations. Attenuation properties, tenth-value layers (TVLs), and dose distributions were calculated for an 18 MV LINAC vault, and departmental floor plans were analyzed to estimate capacity gains. Steel–magnetite and Bi₂O₃ concretes demonstrated optimal performance, achieving 23–28% reductions in required shielding volume while maintaining weekly doses (2.53–2.77 × 10⁻² mSv) well below the 0.1 mSv NCRP limit. Spatial modeling indicated that a standard four-vault department could accommodate a fifth treatment vault, representing a 25% increase in patient throughput—approximately 2,000 additional patients per year. These findings suggest that integrating nanomaterial shielding could significantly enhance global radiotherapy access and support a re-evaluation of outdated NCRP design paradigms to align with modern accelerator technologies.},
