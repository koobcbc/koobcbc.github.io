I am a Master's student in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago, with a strong background in machine learning and biology. Currently, I work as a Research Associate in the Department of Radiation and Cellular Oncology at the University of Chicago Medicine, advised by Dr. James Sohn, and as a Data Scientist/AI Engineer at Oncosoft Inc.

Since my undergraduate years, I have been engaged in research at Boston Children's Hospital and UChicago Medicine, contributing to projects spanning the quantitative analysis of metal artifact reduction in radiation oncology and the investigation of stress granules in immunological contexts.

Alongside my research, I bring several years of academic and professional experience as an AI engineer and software engineer in biotech companies, working on projects involving machine learning models with single-cell flow cytometry data, large language models (LLMs), and multimodal AI systems.
