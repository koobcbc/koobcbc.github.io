In August 2025, I had the opportunity to present my research at the **US-Korea Conference** in Atlanta, Georgia. This conference brings together researchers, professionals, and students from the United States and Korea to share scientific advances and foster international collaboration.

## The Presentation

I presented a **poster** on our research: **"Quantitative Comparison of CT Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) Algorithms in Radiation Oncology"**. This work, conducted in collaboration with Dr. James J. Sohn and colleagues, addresses critical challenges in radiation therapy planning for patients with metal implants.

## Conference Experience

The US-Korea Conference provided an excellent platform for:

- **International Collaboration**: Connecting with researchers from both the US and Korea working on similar problems
- **Interdisciplinary Exchange**: Learning about advances in medical physics, engineering, and related fields
- **Cultural Bridge**: Experiencing the unique blend of American and Korean scientific communities
- **Professional Development**: Gaining experience presenting research to an international audience

The poster session format allowed for in-depth discussions with attendees who were particularly interested in our quantitative approach and its clinical implications.

## Significance

This research contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of quantitative metrics in medical imaging evaluation. By establishing objective benchmarks, we can:

- Help radiation oncology departments make data-driven decisions about CT system selection
- Improve treatment planning accuracy for patients with metal implants
- Guide future algorithm development efforts

## Reflection

Presenting at an international conference like the US-Korea Conference was a valuable experience that broadened my perspective on global research in medical physics. The diverse audience brought different viewpoints and questions that enriched my understanding of the work's potential impact.

As a Korean-American researcher, it was particularly meaningful to present at a conference that celebrates the scientific contributions of both countries. The event highlighted the importance of international collaboration in advancing medical science and improving patient care worldwide.

## Looking Forward

This presentation was part of a series of conference presentations on this work, including the UChicagoGRAD Transcending Boundaries Symposium and the RSNA Annual Meeting. Each venue has provided unique opportunities to share our findings and receive feedback from different communities.

The research continues to evolve, and we're excited about the potential for these quantitative methods to improve clinical practice in radiation oncology.
