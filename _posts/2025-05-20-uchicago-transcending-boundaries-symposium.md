In May 2025, I had the honor of presenting my research at the **UChicagoGRAD 7th Annual Transcending Boundaries Research Symposium** at the University of Chicago. This symposium brings together graduate students from across disciplines to showcase their innovative research and foster interdisciplinary collaboration.

## The Presentation

I delivered an **oral presentation** on our work titled **"Quantitative Comparison of CT Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) Algorithms in Radiation Oncology"**. This research, conducted in collaboration with Dr. James J. Sohn and colleagues at the Department of Radiation and Cellular Oncology, addresses a critical challenge in radiation therapy planning.

## Impact and Significance

This research establishes a **quantitative benchmarking framework** for cross-vendor MAR performance, offering objective metrics to:

- Inform system selection for radiation oncology departments
- Improve confidence in CT-based treatment planning for patients with metal implants
- Guide future development of MAR algorithms

The work has been submitted to *Radiation Physics and Chemistry* and is currently under minor revision.

## Symposium Experience

Presenting at the Transcending Boundaries Symposium was an enriching experience. The interdisciplinary nature of the event allowed me to:

- Share our medical physics research with a diverse audience
- Receive valuable feedback from researchers across different fields
- Learn about innovative work happening across the university
- Connect with fellow graduate students passionate about advancing their fields

The symposium highlighted the importance of clear communication and the value of presenting complex technical research in an accessible way. It was particularly rewarding to discuss how our quantitative methods could benefit clinical practice and patient care.

## Reflection

This presentation marked an important milestone in my research journey at the University of Chicago. It reinforced my appreciation for the collaborative nature of scientific research and the importance of rigorous quantitative methods in medical physics.

As I continue to work on this project and others in radiation oncology, I'm excited to see how these findings can contribute to improving treatment planning accuracy and ultimately, patient outcomes.
